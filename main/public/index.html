            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>Science knows no limits or borders. Scientific inquiry has therefore gone global long before the economy
                or culture. Nevertheless, this does not necessarily mean that science is global to the same extent everywhere.</p>

            <p>To what extent are scientific outputs published in global as opposed to local journals? How does this
                differ across countries and disciplines? How much has this changed over the last decade?</p>

            <p>The aim of this study is to show that. We provide new evidence on the globalization of
                science that allows us to compare over space, fields and time. Specifically, we compare 174 <a class="modalLink" onclick="showModal('modCountries')">countries</a>
                and various <a class="modalLink" onclick="showModal('modCountryGroups')">country groups</a> in 4 broad
                and 27 narrow <a class="modalLink" onclick="showModal('modDisciplines')">disciplines</a> over the period
                from 2005 to 2017.</p>

            <p>The study is based on six <a class="modalLink" onclick="showMethodModal('euclid')">journal-level indicators</a>
                of globalization. The benchmark indicators are derived from the data on authors by the country of
                origin. For comparison, we also use data on documents by the country of origin and
                English-written documents.</p>

            <p>The journal-level indicators are then <a class="modalLink" onclick="showModal('modFramework')">aggregated to countries and disciplines</a>.
                These results are standardized between 0 and 1, in which 0 refers to the lowest and 1 to the highest globalization.</p>

            <p>The analysis is based on <a class="modalLink" onclick="showModal('modScopus')">data </a>
                from the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.scopus.com/">Scopus citation database</a>.
                The list of journals and assigned disciplines is obtained from the <a href="data/ext_list_April_2018_2017_Metrics.xlsx" target="_blank">Scopus Source List</a>.</p>

            <p>Globalization of science should not be confused with quality (or relevance) of science; they are likely to be
                related in many ways, depending on the discipline, but they are different phenomena.</p>

            <p>The results are presented in an interactive manner that allows readers to customize the analysis. Further,
                the results should be of interest not only to academics, but also to policy-makers and to a broader audience across the globe.</p>

            <h3>Bear in mind while using</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>The globalization indexes are standardized between 0 and 1 across all countries (174), narrow
                    disciplines (27) and years (13).</li>
                <li>Large year-by-year jumps in some series can be driven by adding (or removing) important journals in Scopus.</li>
                <li>Results for country groups are computed as simple averages of member countries. Germany has the same
                    weight as Luxembourg, etc. </li>
                <li>Results for broad and narrow disciplines are calculated separately from scratch; the former are not
                    simply aggregations of the latter.</li>
                <li>Only data on the following document types are taken into account: journal articles, reviews, and conference papers.</li>
                <li>Journals are fully counted in each discipline, to which they are assigned. Large interdisciplinary
                    journals may affect the results for smaller disciplines.</li>
                <li>Comparison of indicators within a country or a discipline could be misleading, hence not provided.</li>
                <li>The Gini-Simpson and Local Authors indicators do not take into account the research sector size in the estimation.</li>
                <li>For the sake of robustness, only journals with at least 30 documents in the given year are included
                    in the calculation.</li>
                <li>Only results of the aggregation to countries and disciplines based on data from at least 30
                    journals are reported.</li>
                <li>Smaller countries and disciplines suffer from gaps in the displayed results due to insufficient data.</li>
                <li>Results for smaller countries and disciplines based on relatively thin data should be interpreted with caution.</li>

                <p>Not surprisingly, the Unites States jointly with the EU-28 set the upper standard, followed by Japan.</p>
                <p>China scores last initially, but then globalizes its science base enormously, eventually
                    converging to a similar level as Brazil and India.</p>

                <p>In advanced countries, science is, on average, highly globalized across disciplines.</p>
                <p>Physical and Life Sciences are the most globalized. Health Sciences rank even below Social Sciences,
                    though the differences are very small.</p>
                <p>In fact, it is difficult to find a sub-discipline that deviates significantly from this narrow corridor.</p>

                <p>Russian Physical and Life Sciences remain significantly less globalized than elsewhere in the world.</p>
                <p>The only major exception is the sub-discipline of Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics.</p>
                <p>Interestingly, in many disciplines this is in a sharp contrast to the relatively high
                    share of documents published in English.</p>
                <p>In fact, about four-fifths of documents with at least one author from Russia were written

                <p>Chinese Social Sciences have become even more globalized than other broad disciplines and have already caught up
                    with the EU-28 and the world average.</p>
                <p>In some sub-disciplines, China has already surpassed the United States and is steaming forward to the top ranking.</p>
                <p>If the trend continues, China will soon eliminate the gap with advanced countries in most of the sub-disciplines.</p>

            <h3>Concluding remarks</h3>
            <p>Globalization of science provides a new perspective on the scientific landscape, which deepens what we know
                from standard bibliometrics in many respects.</p>

            <p>The traditional science powerhouses in the North and West remain strong and at the core of the global
                system; highly interconnected and as globalized as ever.</p>

            <p>In many countries of the former Soviet block, the low globalization of science is a symptom of a systemic failure;
                of science that is out of sync with the rest of the world and is inefficient.</p>

            <p>After the fall of the Berlin Wall, it was understandable that science in transition countries would need time
                to catch up. In many disciplines, new infrastructure had to be built from scratch. However, three decades on,
                there is no longer any excuse.</p>

            <p>China shows that where there is a will, there is a way. In little more than a decade, Chinese science has moved from
                relative isolation to the front pages of global journals amid an enormously expansion in size.</p>

            <p>Other developing countries also allocate increasing resources to science and run the risk of creating
                ecosystems of local publishing similar to transition countries or worse, e.g. falling for predatory journals.</p>

            <p>Globalization of science that is pervasively lower than in similar countries should be a cause for concern,
                as it suggests that the science system has gone astray and needs an overhaul of its evaluation and funding framework.</p>

            <p>More research is needed to better understand globalization of science. Does globalization of the national
                science system go hand in hand with quality and impact? Are there spillovers outside of the realm of science?
                What can be done about it?</p>

            <p class="tip">Tip: Spend more time with the interactive app to explore the position of the country and discipline
                of your interest.</p>

                <h3>Local Journals in Scopus</h3>
                <p>In this study, we analyzed local academic publishing in selected European countries over the 2013-2016 period.</p>
                <p>The results reveal a strong tendency to publish locally in the former communist countries. Local
                    journals are prevalent in Croatia, Romania, Slovenia, Lithuania and Czechia, but are rather rare in
                    comparable advanced countries. </p>
                <p>In Czechia, for instance, nearly one fifth of all indexed results are concentrated in Czech journals,
                    with a high percentage (>33%) of articles by domestic authors. About half of authors contributing to
                    Czech journals are based in Czechia, and another tenth in Slovakia.</p>
                <p>In contrast, the vast majority of articles that appear in journals published in comparable advanced
                    countries are written by foreign authors. The publishing of local, or at best regional, journals appears
                    to be a distinctly Eastern European phenomenon.</p>

                <h3>Predatory Journals in Scopus</h3>
                <p>In this study, we mapped patterns of predatory publishing across the globe over the 2015-2017 period.</p>
                <p>The analysis is based on Beall's lists of "potentially predatory" journals and publishers, of which
                    we found 3,218 journals in Ulrichsweb and 405 journals in Scopus.</p>
                <p>The results show that predatory publishing has become most widespread in middle-income countries in
                    Asia and North Africa. </p>
                <p>However, the analysis also indicates that Beall’s lists need to be used with caution, as some of the
                    implicated journals may not be necessarily fraudulent in the strict sense.</p>

                <h3>International Comparison of Academic Publication Output and its Influence</h3>
                <p>The study compares quantity and influence of publication output of countries in Web of Science (WoS)
                    by category over the 2012-2016 period.</p>
                <p>The quantity is given by the number of scientific articles and the influence is inferred from Article
                    Influence Score (AIS) of the journals they are published in.</p>
                <p>For each WoS category, the output and influence of the country is benchmarked relative to the chosen set of other countries.</p>
                <p>The results reveal that both the size and influence of research in most Central and Eastern European countries
                    continue to lag behind Western Europe.</p>
                <p>This gap is especially strong in <i>Social Sciences</i>, <i>Medical and Health Sciences</i>, and <i> Arts and Humanities</i></p>

                <h3>Aggregation to countries and disciplines</h3>

                <p>Following <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02459619" target="_blank">Zitt and Bassecoulard (1999)</a>, the evidence from journals
                    is aggregated to the level of countries and disciplines.</p>

                <p>The aggregated figures are calculated as an average of the
                    <a class="modalLink" onclick="hideAndShowModal('modMethods')">journal-level indicator</a> weighted by
                    the journal's share on the country's total documents in the respective discipline.</p>
                <p>Only the results of the aggregation procedure based on data from at least 30 journals are reported.</p>

                <h4>Definitions</h4>
                <p>Globalization of science in the country $c$, discipline $d$ and year $y$ measured by the indicator $i$
                    is calculated as follows:</p>
                $$
                G_{c,d,y,i} = \sum_{j=1}^{J} a_{c,d,y,j} g_{j,d,y,i}(.)
                $$
                <p>$a_{j,c,d,y}$ is the share of documents with authors from the country $c$ in journal $j$ on all
                    documents of the country $c$ in discipline $d$ in year $y$.</p>

                <p>$g_{j,d,y,i}$ is the globalization indicator $i$ of journal $j$ in discipline $d$ and year $y$.</p>


                <h4>Standardization and scaling</h4>
                <p>Subsequently, the aggregated globalization index was standardized between $0$ and $1$ and converted
                    to an ascending scale to simplify interpretation of the results:</p>
                $$
                G_{c,d,y,i}^S = \frac{G_{c,d,y,i} - G_{i}^{min}}{G_{i}^{max} - G_{i}^{min}} \alpha_i
                $$
                <p>in which $G_{i}^{min}$ and $G_{i}^{max}$ is the minimum and maximum value of the indicator $i$ across all years,
                    countries, and disciplines and $\alpha_i$ equals $-1$ for the minimizing indicator (i.e. low values for
                    high globalization) and $1$ otherwise, as the results of which $0$ refers to the lowest and $1$
                    to the highest globalization.

                <h3>Journal Globalization Indicators</h3>

                <p>The methodology builds on the pioneering work of <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02457982" target="_blank">Zitt and Bassecoulard (1998)</a>, which we complement
                    with the contributions by <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11192-006-0050-z" target="_blank">Buela-Casal (2006)</a>, <a href="http://ocs.editorial.upv.es/index.php/STI2016/STI2016/paper/viewFile/4543/2327" target="_blank">Aman (2016)</a>
                    and two indicators of our own.</p>
                <p>In essence, the most globalized journals have a structure (of documents by the country of origin of
                    authors, etc.) that closely resembles the global structure of the whole discipline and vice-versa.</p>
                <p>Only journals with at least 30 documents in the particular year are included in the calculation.</p>

                <h4>Definitions</h4>
                <p>$N_{c,j,y}$ and $N_{c,d,y}$ is the number of documents with authors affiliated to the country $c$ in
                    journal $j$ and the discipline $d$, respectively, in year $y$.</p>
                <p>$N_{LOCAL,j,y}$ is the number of documents with authors from the same country as the publisher of journal $j$
                    in year $y$.</p>
                <p>$N_{ENG,j,y}$ is the number of English-written documents in the journal $j$ in year $y$.</p>
                <p>$T_{j,y}$ denotes the total number of documents published in the journal $j$ in year $y$.</p>
                <p>Note: Documents by authors from multiple countries are fully attributed to each country, i.e. $T_{j,y} \neq \sum_c N_{c,j,y}$.</p>
