            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>To which extent are scientific outputs published in global in contrast to local journals? How does this
                tendency differ across countries and disciplines? And how much has this publication landscape changed
                over the last decade or so?</p>

            <p>Science knows no limits and boundaries. Scientific inquiry has therefore gone global long before the economy
                or culture. Yet this does not necessarily mean that science has been global to the same extent everywhere and anywhere. </p>

            <p>The aim of this study is to show just that. We provide fresh and unique evidence on the globalization of
                science that allows for a comparison over space, fields and time, namely for 174 <a class="modalLink" onclick="showModal('modCountries')">countries</a>
                and various <a class="modalLink" onclick="showModal('modCountryGroups')">country groups</a> in 4 broad
                and 27 narrow <a class="modalLink" onclick="showModal('modDisciplines')">disciplines</a> over 2005 to 2017.</p>

            <p>The study is based on six <a class="modalLink" onclick="showMethodModal('euclid')">journal-level indicators</a>
                of globalization. The benchmark indicators are derived from the composition of authors by the country of
                origin. For comparison, we also use data on the number of documents by the country of origin and
                English-written documents.</p>

            <p>The journal-level indicators are then <a class="modalLink" onclick="showModal('modFramework')">aggregated to countries and disciplines</a>.
                These results are standardized between 0 and 1, where 0 refers to the lowest and 1 to the highest globalization.</p>

            <p>The analysis is based on <a class="modalLink" onclick="showModal('modScopus')">data for 34 964 journals</a>
                from the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.scopus.com/">Scopus citation database</a> (downloaded in August 2018).
                The list of journals and assigned disciplines is obtained from the <a href="https://www.scopus.com/sources" target="_blank">Scopus Source List</a> (May 2018 version).</p>

            <p>Globalization of science should not be confused with its quality (or relevance); they are likely to be
                related in many interesting ways, depending of the discipline, but they are measured differently and
                capture different phenomena.</p>

            <p>The results are presented in a user-friendly and interactive way that allows readers to customize the output.
                The result should be of interest not only to academics and research managers but also to policy-makers and broader audience across the globe. </p>

            <h3>Bear in mind while using</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Large year-by-year jumps is some series can be driven by adding (or removing) important journals in Scopus.</li>
                <li>The globalization indexes are standardized between 0 and 1 across all countries (174), narrow
                    disciplines (27) and years (13).</li>
                <li>Results for country groups are computed as simple averages of member countries. Germany has the same
                    weight as Luxembourg, etc. </li>
                <li>Results for broad and narrow disciplines are calculated separately from scratch; the former are not
                    simply aggregations of the latter.</li>
                <li>Only data on document types of a journal article, review and conference paper are taken into account.</li>
                <li>Journals are fully counted in each discipline, to which they are assigned. Large interdisciplinary
                    journals may affect results for smaller disciplines.</li>
                <li>Comparison of indicators within a country or a discipline could be misleading, hence not facilitated.</li>
                <li>Gini-Simpson and Local Authors indicators do not take into account the research sector size in the estimation.</li>
                <li>For the sake of robustness, only journals with at least 30 documents in the given year are included
                    in the calculations.</li>
                <li>Only results of the aggregation to countries and disciplines based on reliable data from at least 30
                    journals are reported.</li>
                <li>Smaller countries and disciplines suffer from gaps in the displayed results due to insufficient data.</li>
                <li>Results for smaller countries and disciplines based on relatively thin data should be interpreted with caution.</li>

            <h3>Concluding remarks</h3>
            <p>Globalization of science provides a new perspective on the scientific landscape, which in many respects
                deepens what we know from standard bibliometrics.</p>

            <p>The traditional science powerhouses in the North and West remain strong and at the core of the global
                system; highly interconnected and globalized as ever.</p>

            <p>In many countries of the former Soviet block, the low globalization of science is symptomatic of a systemic
                failure; of science that is out of sync with the rest of the world, inefficient and small-minded.</p>

            <p>After the fall of the Berlin Wall, it was understandable that science in transition countries needs time
                to catch-up. In many disciplines, new infrastructure had to be built from scratch. But three decades
                onwards, there is no excuse.</p>

            <p>China shows that where is a will there is way. In little more than one decade, Chinese science moved from
                a relative isolation to the front pages of global journals amid enormously expanding in size; this is quite remarkable.</p>

            <p>So far not much has been said about other developing countries, many of which steer increasing resources
                to science; they too are in the risk of creating ecosystems of local publishing or worse such as falling
                for predatory journals.</p>

            <p>Globalization of science that is pervasively lower than in similar countries should be a cause for concern
                that the science system has drifted astray and a call for thinking again about incentives in the evaluation
                and funding framework.</p>

            <p>Science does not happen in a vacuum. Not only historical but also current political reasons are in play.
                Social sciences are particularly in the fray, precisely because global and independent research in this
                field tends to provide feedback on governance, which may not always be appreciated by those in power.</p>

            <p>More research is needed to better understand globalization of science, including the measurement and indicators.
                Does globalization of the national science system go hand in hand with quality and impact? Are there
                broader spillovers outside of the realm of science? And what can be done about it?</p>

                <h3>Local Journals in Scopus</h3>
                <p>In this study, Vít Macháček and Martin Srholec analysed local academic publishing in selected European
                    countries over the period 2013-2016. </p>
                <p>The results revealed strong tendency to publish locally in the former communist countries. Local
                    journals are prevalent in Croatia, Romania, Slovenia, Lithuania or Czechia but rather rare in
                    comparable advanced countries. </p>
                <p>In Czechia, for instance, nearly one fifth of all indexed results are concentrated in Czech journals
                    with a high percentage (>33%) of articles by domestic authors. About half of authors contributing to
                    Czech journals are based in Czechia, and another tenth in Slovakia.</p>
                <p>In contrast, the vast majority of articles which come out in journals published in comparable advanced
                    countries are written by foreigners. The publishing of national, or at best regional, indexed journals
                    appears to be a distinctly Eastern European phenomenon.</p>

                <h3>Predatory Journals in Scopus</h3>
                <p>In this study, Vít Macháček and Martin Srholec mapped patterns of predatory publishing across the globe
                    over the period 2015-2017.</p>
                <p>The analysis is based on Beall's lists of "potentially predatory" journals and publishers, of which
                    we found 3 218 journals in Ulrichsweb and 405 journals in Scopus.</p>
                <p>The results shows that predatory publishing has become most widespread in middle-income countries in
                    Asia and North Africa. </p>
                <p>However, the analysis also indicates that Beall’s lists need to be used with caution, as some of the
                    implicated journals may not be necessarily fraudulent.</p>

                <h3>Aggregation to countries and disciplines</h3>

                <p>Following <a href="" target="_blank">Zitt and Bassecoulard (1999)</a>, the evidence from journals
                    is aggregated to the level of countries and disciplines.</p>

                <p>The aggregated figures are calculated as an average of the
                    <a class="modalLink" onclick="hideAndShowModal('modMethods')">journal-level indicator</a> weighted by
                    the journal's share on the country total documents in the respective discipline.</p>
                <p>Only results of the aggregation procedure based on data from at least 30 journals are reported.</p>

                <h4>Definitions</h4>
                <p>Globalization of science in the country $c$, discipline $d$ and in year $y$ measured by the
                    indicator $i$ is calculated as follows:</p>
                $$
                G_{c,d,y,i} = \sum_{j=1}^{J} a_{c,d,y,j} g_{j,d,y,i}(.) C_i
                $$
                <p>$a_{j,c,d,y}$ is the share of documents with authors from the country $c$ in the journal $j$ on all
                    documents of the country $c$ in the discipline $d$ in the year $y$.</p>

                <p>$g_{j,d,y,i}$ is the globalization indicator $i$ of journal $j$ in the discipline $d$ in the year $y$.</p>


                <h4>Standardization and scaling</h4>
                <p>Subsequently, the aggregated globalization index was standardized between $0$ and $1$ and converted
                    to ascending scale to simplify interpretation of the results:</p>
                $$
                G_{c,d,y,i}^S = \frac{G_{c,d,y,i} - G_{i}^{min}}{G_{i}^{max} - G_{i}^{min}} \alpha_i
                $$
                <p>where $G_{i}^{min}$ and $G_{i}^{max}$ is minimum and maximum value of the indicator i across all years,
                    countries and disciplines and $\alpha_i$ equals to $-1$ for the minimizing indicator (i.e. low values for
                    high globalization) and $1$ otherwise, as the results of which $0$ refers to the lowest and $1$
                    to the highest globalization.

                <h3>Journal Globalization Indicators</h3>

                <p>The methodology builds on the pioneering work by <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02457982" target="_blank">Zitt and Bassecoulard (1998)</a>, which we complement
                    by the recent contribution by <a href="http://ocs.editorial.upv.es/index.php/STI2016/STI2016/paper/viewFile/4543/2327" target="_blank">Aman (2016)</a>
                    and three indicators of our own.</p>
                <p>In essence, the indicators are based on the idea that the most globalized journals have structure
                    (documents by the country of origin of authors, etc.) that closely resembles the global discipline
                    aggregate and vice versa.</p>
                <p>Only journals with at least 30 documents in the particular year are included in the calculation.</p>

                <h4>Definitions</h4>
                <p>$N_{c,j,y}$ and $N_{c,d,y}$ is the number of documents with authors affiliated to the country $c$ in
                    the journal $j$ and the discipline $d$, respectively, in the year $y$.</p>
                <p>$N_{LOCAL,j,y}$ is the number of documents with authors from the same country as the journal's publisher
                    in the year $y$.</p>
                <p>$N_{ENG,j,y}$ is the number of English-written documents.</p>
                <p>$T_{j,y}$ denotes the total number of documents published in the journal $j$ in the year $y$</p>
                <p>Documents by authors from multiple countries are fully attributed to each country, i.e. $T_{j,y} \neq \sum_c N_{c,j,y}$ </p>
